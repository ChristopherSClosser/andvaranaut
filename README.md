# andvaranaut

Andvaranaut aims to be a 2.5D dungeon crawler with procedural dungeon generation.
Your inventory is like a deck of cards; lootbags dropped by enemies are like booster packs.
Dive deep into the dungeon and tailor your combat preferences to melee, magic, archery, and gunpowder.

    make; ./andvaranaut
